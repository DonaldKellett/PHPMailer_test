# PHPMailer_test

## Overview

A very quick test I whipped up to see how PHPMailer works.  Contains a working contact form asking for the author's name, email address, subject and message.  Email is sent using the ```PHPMailer``` library instead of the built-in PHP ```mail()``` function.

## Aim

To learn how PHPMailer works and ultimately using it to replace the built-in PHP ```mail()``` function in *all* of my future projects (including my personal websites and preferably client websites as well).  This test was a *success* which means I will be implementing this library in various parts of my website.

## Scope

This script/demo/page/whatever has been tested in ```localhost``` and proven to work.
